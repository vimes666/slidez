# Slideshow generator for linux mint mate desktop background.

This PHP script generates an XML file that can be used as a background slideshow in the linux mint mate desktop. It _recursively_ collects the names of all image files that are present in the directory from where the script is invoked. 
The XML file is named slideshow.xml and it is placed in current working directory.
The script randomizes the order of the images.
